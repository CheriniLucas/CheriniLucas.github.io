                        <p class="text-muted">I don't know about you, but I always look for a way to beat the casino, but how?</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">First, let's analyze how a casino works, what games the majority have, at least in Argentina, and which one we should play to maximize our profits.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">A casino is an establishment in which the main attraction is gambling. The logic of all these games consists, at its most basic level, in that a player places a bet in one of the games where, if the condition to win is met, the player is returned a sum equal to or greater than his bet, or otherwise, the player loses his bet.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The conditions to win, the bets and the winnings, are stipulated in advance. These are determined by statistics in order to give the casino a certain advantage. In this way, if we think of a player who plays forever, the balance would be in favor of the casino according to the previously stipulated proportion. It should be noted that these probabilities in electronic games are regulated by the regulatory body so that they are not abusive against the population, but the lack of periodic controls means that this is not always fulfilled.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Now, assuming that everything works correctly, what game do we play? In casinos we can find slot machines, roulette, blackjack, craps and poker.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">We must analyze how our interaction with the game is. If our goal is to maximize the chances of winning, we must discard all those in which we cannot decide the value of the bet or the way in which we do it, therefore the slots are left out.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">On the other hand, there is Poker, which, although it is random, depends largely on the player's ability, this being the one with the greatest chance of winning. As this depends exclusively on the player, it is not possible to obtain a method that replicates the results for all people, therefore, it is also ruled out for this analysis.</p>
                        <p class="mb-5 text-muted">Finally there are roulette, blackjack and craps. In these games, in addition to chance, there is player interaction, which gives us the chance to plan a strategy to increase our chances of winning. To determine which of them gives better chances, let's review their game rules and calculate the probabilities.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Craps</h2>

                        <!-- Image-->
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="/assets/programming/matlab/casino-games/craps.jpg" alt="Craps">
    
                        <p class="text-muted">When playing in a casino against the bank, or house, one or more players place various bets on the result that will be obtained from the dice thrown by one of the players, which is designated shooter. To start the game, during what is known as the come out roll, the player needs to place a bet known as a pass line, in which they seek to obtain a seven (known as a natural seven or winning seven) or an eleven in the combination of dice to win the bet, which pays one to one. If instead he gets a two, three or twelve (numbers known as craps) he automatically loses his bet and will need to place a bet again to keep rolling.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">If during the first throw you do not get a seven or eleven (with which you win), or a two, three or twelve (with which you lose), the game will enter a second stage, in which the point will be marked on the number that is get on that toss (four, five, six, eight, nine, or ten). At this stage, the shooter will seek to get that number on the dice again, thus winning the roll or round, before getting a seven, called a seven out. If he manages to repeat the number of the point, the player will win his bet and the amount will be paid one by one. If, on the other hand, a seven appears, he will lose his bet. In both cases, the round is considered to have ended and the game starts again, although if the round ended due to a seven out, a new shooter will be designated from among the different players.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Calculating the probabilities of these situations gives us a 22.22% chance of winning on the starting shot and 11.11% of losing. If any other number comes up, you go to the second stage where you must get the same value obtained to win, and you lose with 7. Now the new probabilities will depend on the number obtained previously, which will be 13.89% for the numbers 6 and 8, 11.11% for numbers 5 and 9, and 8.33% for numbers 4 and 10, so we are at a disadvantage against 7, which has a probability of coming out of 16.66%.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Due to the way the game is developed, I do not recommend it, since we start with a 66% probability of going to the second stage where the probability of winning, in the best case, is 14%.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">A better option is that our bet was of the type "don't pass bar", which is practically the opposite of what is described above (but with 12 as the tie number). In this way you would have a better chance of winning, although it would still be less than losing.</p>
                        <p class="mb-5 text-muted">With all this, I dismiss dice as a game with which you can win in the long run.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Blackjack</h2>

                        <!-- Image-->
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="/assets/programming/matlab/casino-games/blackjack.jpg" alt="Blackjack">
    
                        <p class="text-muted">Blackjack, also called twenty-one, is a card game with one or more English decks of 52 cards without jokers, which consists of adding a value as close to 21 but without going over. Each player at the table plays solely against the dealer, trying to get a better hand than the dealer. The dealer is subject to fixed rules that prevent him from making decisions about the game. For example, he is required to hit whenever his score is 16 or less, and is required to stand if he is 17 or more. The number cards add up their value, the figures add up to 10 and the Ace is worth 11 or 1, at the player's choice. In the case of the dealer, the Aces are worth 11 as long as they do not go over 21, and 1 otherwise. The best play is to get 21 with only two cards, that is with an Ace plus a 10-value card. This play is known as Blackjack or natural 21. A Blackjack wins over a 21 made with more than two cards.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">The dealer deals two visible cards to each player, then puts his first card face up so that it is visible to the rest of the players, who can make their decisions based on that card, while the dealer will have a second card face down in waiting for your turn. Each player competes only against the dealer, being indifferent to the cards that the rest of the other players have.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Each player has the possibility to stand and keep any score, or to ask for more cards until reaching 21 points. Reaching 21 points with more than one extra card is not considered blackjack, thus being inferior to blackjack with two cards. If, when requesting a new card, it exceeds 21, the player automatically loses the game, and his cards and bet will be withdrawn by the dealer. When all players have called for their cards, the dealer will show their second card face down and draw more cards if necessary until they total 17 or more points to reach number 21, at which point they will stand.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Between the dealer and each player, whoever obtains blackjack (Ace+10) or whoever has the highest score without exceeding 21 points finally wins, with the possibility of a tie and recovering the bet.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">These are the probabilities of going overboard by asking for an extra card:</p>

                        <!-- Image-->
                        <div class="container col-lg-8">

                        </div>

                        <p class="mb-5 text-muted">Getting the exact odds for this game requires further study due to the large number of variations that can occur and would take more time than I have available at this time. Broadly speaking, we can still say that the dealer has an advantage over the players, since they not only compete against him, but also against themselves, because if they go over 21 they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has. However, there are techniques to increase the odds of winning, but they are not welcome if we are caught using them.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-4">Roulette</h2>

                        <!-- Image-->
                        <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="/assets/programming/matlab/casino-games/roulette.png" alt="Roulette">
    
                        <p class="text-muted">The design that is currently used in casino roulette wheels is due to the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal, who was looking for a game where chance was as fair as possible.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">In that design, the order is based on the following rules:</p>

                        <!-- box-->
                        <div class="container col-lg-10 text-box mb-4">
                            <p class="text-muted">On each side of a number less than or equal to 18 there is a number greater than 18 and vice versa, with two exceptions: a) zero, b) right in front of it with the 5 and 10 together.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">The black numbers are those in which the reduction of the sum of their digits is even. So, for example, 29 is black (2 + 9 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2). The exceptions are 10 and 28 (both black).</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">Dividing the plate in half, with an imaginary line between 0 and 5, in each of the halves there must be the same number of numbers that belong to each of the 3 dozen (6 numbers of each dozen) and the same number of numbers that belong to each of the 3 columns (6 numbers from each column).</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">The red and black numbers must be alternated.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted">The odd and even numbers must be evenly distributed so that there are no more than two adjacent odd or even numbers.</p>
                        </div>


                        <p class="text-muted">These rules are met in European roulette (with a zero), but not in American roulette (with double zero), where the distribution is more irregular.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Depending on the type of bet, the following payments can be made:</p>

                        <!-- Image-->
                        <div class="container col-lg-10">

                        </div>

                        <p class="text-muted">and the probabilities that they will come out are (taking into account the worst situation with the American version):</p>

                        </div>

                        <p class="text-muted">For the analysis we are going to use the <strong>Martingale</strong> betting method. This consists of staying with the simple bets, choosing a category (for the example I am going to take red) and keeping it until I win. This method is based on the fact that if it came out black, the probability of it coming out again is lower, and if it comes out again, the next one will be even lower, and so on until it comes out red. Keep in mind that you start with the minimum bet, and every time you lose you have to double the bet. When you win, the cycle restarts with the minimum bet. But how effective is it?</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Well, carrying out an exhaustive analysis with MatLab, I obtained that the probability is closely related to the minimum and maximum bet that the table allows, since this determines the number of times that we will be able to double our bet each time we lose. From the data that I was able to obtain on minimum and maximum bets generally admitted by casinos, we will be able to double our bet between 6 and 8 times. If we think that the probability of losing 8 times in a row while always maintaining the same color is 0.5%, it is easy to be tempted to think that the system is infallible, but nothing is further from the truth.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Through the mathematical model I discovered that even if we had no limitations with the bets, and therefore no limitations on the number of times we could double it, the ability to generate long-term profits is nil.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">Simulating that I bet 240 times a day (once every 2 minutes for 8 hours) for 1,000,000 days, the probability of winning was around 31%, with which the initial assumption applying the Martingale method falls apart, since in the long run term we end up losing 7 out of 10 games.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">An interesting situation occurs when studying the hypothetical case in which the casino allows us to double a greater number of times (for the example I take 20 times, which is 1,048,576 times the initial bet) and assuming that we have the necessary money, we run the simulation at 1,000,000 days. It turns out that the probability of winning goes up to 99%, but when analyzing the balance of capital during the development of the simulation we find that we lost money. Despite having won 99% of the time, the capital needed to start each cycle we lost was much higher than that generated in the won games.</p>
                        <p class="mb-5 text-muted">Below I leave images of some of the cycles (positive and negative); from the general calculation to 1,000,000 days with up to 6 and 8 bet increases; and two hypothetical cases with up to 12 and 20 bet increases.</p>
